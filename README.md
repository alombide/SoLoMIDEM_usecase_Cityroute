Cityroute
=========

The ./clientpage/js/auth/config,js file must be edited if you want to deploy the app locally (you'll need a local MongoDB as well).

var config_serverAddress = "cityroute.herokuapp.com"; 
//Comment the above and uncomment this for a local deployment
//var config_serverAddress = "localhost:8888";


This is the CityLife Routing API.
It includes both the back-end and a front-end responsive website for demo purposes.
